The dataset is based on synthetic healthcare admission data, which has been processed, transformed, and augmented to simulate conversational turns. The goal is to create a resource that can be used to fine-tune LLMs for tasks related to clinical communication.\n","\n","The process involved several key steps:\n","1.  **Data Understanding:** Examining the dataset structure, columns, and data types to identify relevant features for clinical conversations.\n","2.  **Preprocessing:** Cleaning the data, including handling missing values and encoding categorical variables using one-hot encoding.\n","3.  **Feature Engineering/Selection:** Selecting the most relevant features for simulating clinical conversations.\n","4.  **Data Transformation:** Converting the structured data into a text-based conversational format.\n","5.  **Data Augmentation:** Applying simple techniques to increase the variability of the generated conversation text.\n","6.  **Dataset Split:** Dividing the dataset into training, validation, and testing sets for model development and evaluation.\n","7.  **Dataset Formatting:** Preparing the dataset splits in a format compatible with common LLM training frameworks.\n","\n","The resulting dataset provides a foundation for training LLMs on simulated clinical interactions, which can be further enhanced with more sophisticated augmentation and domain-specific vocabulary."]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":206},"id":"2cbc7bca","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1757684795368,"user_tz":-60,"elapsed":687,"user":{"displayName":"aniakwa
