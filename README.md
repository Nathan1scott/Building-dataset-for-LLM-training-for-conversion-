I’ve been working with a notebook titled “Building a Dataset for LLM Training for Clinical Conversations”.

The focus is on preparing structured datasets that can help large language models (LLMs) better understand and engage in clinical dialogues. This is a crucial step toward making AI tools more reliable, accurate, and useful in healthcare applications.

It’s exciting to see how data preparation lays the foundation for impactful AI solutions in the medical field.
